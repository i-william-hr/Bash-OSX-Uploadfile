Requires:
- OSX 10.x
- rar binary in path if rar is used

Highly recommended but not required:
- "terminal-notifier" from homebrew as it gives much nicer upload info (status, size..) as notification popup and not ugly "OK" "Cancel" windows...

Install - Client:
- Copy ulf binary to /usr/local/bin/ulf
- If desired install one or more of the supplied workflows via Automator as "Service", allowing usage from context menu/setting shortcuts
- Edit /usr/local/bin/ulf and add at least a server

Install - Server:
- Run some webserver, apt-get install nginx should be mostly sufficient already, then upload to /var/www
- SSH access should be ideally *not* root but webserver user or someone with chmod permissions, then set chmod line in the server config
