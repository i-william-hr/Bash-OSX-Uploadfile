Uploads on OSX - william@william.co.il 03.2025

This script uploads files with new random filename, original filename in a random subfolder or packaged as RAR or ZIP, encrypted if desired.
By default the URL is automatically copied to the clipboard, a config option also enables password copy.
Passwords are by default also saved in a local file with the filename and upload date.

I also included an Automator workflow for screenshot creation/uploaded and context menu upload in Finder.
See INSTALL file in this directory for usage and the workflow directory for Automator workflows (created on 10.12, but should not matter).

Switches:
-h / --help - This help output
-c / --cli - CLI mode for eg. shell usage, returns only URL on stdout if successful or exits with 1
-i / --input - File to upload, full path or sub path of local dir. USE QUOTES, do not escape.
